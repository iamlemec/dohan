## Great paper

---

## Identification strategy

Gotta love those DAGs

---

## Distributing Spillovers

Funding from FOA categories gets distributed to technology classes using "spillover radius" $\bar{s}$.

`$$
\big[ \mathbf{s_1} \quad \mathbf{s_2} \quad \mathbf{s_3} \quad \mathbf{s_4} \quad \mathbf{s_5} \quad \mathbf{s_6} \underbrace{|}_{\bar{s}=6} s_7 \quad s_8 \quad s_9 \quad s_{10} \big]
$$`

Classes ranked in top $\bar{s}$ in terms of similarity *ranking* get even split of FOA funds.
- This has the effect of imposing the same spillover radius for each FOA category.

## Using intensity information

---

## Text analysis methods

Could add in some additional text sources, such as actual CPC description text (quite a bit if you're aggregating to CPC-4). Might want to upweight those and title.

If CPC isn't designed for research, why are we using it? One option would be to make your own groups. You could K-means cluster (or other) the document vectors for patents into similar groups. This would naturally be conducive to the FOA classification.

## Constructing validation set

---

## Construction of windfall instrument

Might be some issues with the intercept and independence between windfall and federal funding.

---

## Substitution between private and public

Fundamentally, we need to be aware here that with these grants, we're merely adding funding to existing operations. True, these are small businesses, but they already do lots of research presumably, and money is pretty fungible in this case. There are conceptual issues here relating to how firms internal investment responds to grant receipt (could go up or down, they might collaborate with university or lab), which would affect the cost estimates. But also, on the empirical side, you'd want to try to have something like class-level fixed effects.

---

Thinking about Cobb-Douglas and baseline investment levels, let $K_j$ be internal investment and $X_j$ be the grant
$$
\log(y) = \alpha \log(K_1) + \beta \log(K_2)
$$

But maybe more like
$$
\log(y) = \alpha \log(P_1+K_1) + \beta \log(P_2+K_2)
$$

---

For option (2), if we look at

$$
\frac{\partial\log(y)}{\partial\log(K_1)} = \alpha \left(\frac{K_1}{P_1+K_1}\right)
$$

If funding is proportional, in which case $X_1 = \gamma_1 K_1$, we get

$$
\frac{\partial\log(y)}{\partial\log(X_1)} = \alpha \left(\frac{\gamma_1}{1+\gamma_1}\right)
$$

---

## Reallocation of scientists

At the end of the day, we know that the stock of scientists is a pretty slow moving object. In the short-run, rather fixed. The question then is how much of the effects that we see here are due to reallocation of scientists/effort from one area of research to another? Depends on how easy it is for scientists to switch areas. The more difficult it is, the more plausible these results seems taken at face value. Thinking about finance/physics/aerospace here.

---

## Interpretation of results

We're not really getting full costs, because we don't see the private investment response of the firms. Particularly with financial and cash flow considerations, this might be important? This is true in a static setting, but probably even more important in a dynamic setting, where firms get multiple rounds of grants over years.

Would it be possible to bring in, at least expositionally, some of the BRDS data from NSF? You'd need a NAICS/CPC crosswalk, which might exist, but could also be done using patents/Compustat. Then at least you could control for something like the average $\gamma$ per class. Or just class fixed effects?
