Both the seminar and the brown bag (lunch talk) will be held regularly, but not every week. Currently both are virtual and will take place on Zoom. Please refer to the schedule on the course website linked above.

Those taking the course are required to attend the seminar and brown bag. Of course, it's okay if you aren't able to make it on occasion. For those taking a grade, if you are a third-year student or above, you are also required to present in the brown bag at least once. Second-year students are not required to present, but you are encouraged to present a second-year paper idea (possibly in a 30 minute format) at some point later in the year.

In general, the brown bag is a great place to present preliminary work and get constructive feedback on how best to proceed. So don't hesitate, reserve your spot on the schedule today! Just send me an email with your desired dates and what you'll be presenting. If you're not sure about whether an idea is ready to be presented or if you're having trouble finding an idea, definitely reach out to me or other faculty and we'll be happy to help.

Additionally, those taking a grade should meet at least once with one of the seminar speakers. It can be a little intimidating, but they're usually nice people, and it really can help you further your research agenda and work on your networking and communications skills. The meeting scheduling this year will be done through a department wide system at https://pitt.seminars.app/. If you're unsure about who to meet with or how speaker meetings usually work, don't hesistate to contact me for guidance.
